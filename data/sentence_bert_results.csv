1705.02798v6,How does reattention affect the redundancy and deficiency of attention distributions? Can you explain the observed differences in the impact of reattention on different blocks?,"This paper shows that reattention helps alleviate both redundancy and deficiency in attention distributions.

Redundancy: Reattention increases the KL divergence between adjacent attention blocks, indicating that the attention distributions across blocks become more distinct and less redundant.
Deficiency: Reattention reduces the KL divergence between the normalized attention distribution ($E^t$) and the ideal uniform distribution (${E^t}^*$), suggesting that the attention becomes more balanced and closer to the desired distribution.
However, the improvement in redundancy is more pronounced between the first two blocks ($E^1$ to $E^2$) than the last two blocks ($B^2$ to $B^3$). This suggests that the first reattention is more effective in capturing word pair similarities using the original word representations. In contrast, the later reattention might be negatively impacted by the highly non-linear word representations generated in the previous layers.",1705.02798v6-Table5-1.png,Table 5: Comparison of KL diverfence on different attention distributions on SQuAD dev set.,"The intra-warrant attention mechanism uses a BiLSTM to encode the reason and claim, and then provides this encoded information as an attention vector to LSTM layers for each warrant.

The discriminator is enhanced by the N-best response candidates returned by a retrieval-based method. The discriminator takes as input a response and outputs the probability that the response is human-generated. The output is then regarded as a reward to guide the generator.,"The model is discouraged because it is trained using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) objective, which prioritizes generating responses that are identical to the ground-truth (GT) response. Even though the RSP integrates relevant content from the candidates and seems appropriate in the context, it is penalized because it deviates from the exact wording of the GT."
1710.01507v4,What is the role of the LSTM network in the model architecture?,The LSTM network is used to process the post text and generate a post text embedding.,1710.01507v4-Figure1-1.png,Model Architecture,"The LSTM-MDN network is used to learn the relationship between the gripper pose and status, the pose of relevant objects, and the joint angles of the robot arm."
1709.00139v4,"Which method generally achieved a lower objective function value (OFV) for the different datasets, FISVDD or Incremental SVM? Does this imply that one method is definitively better than the other?","For all datasets presented, Incremental SVM achieved a slightly lower OFV compared to FISVDD. However, this does not necessarily mean that Incremental SVM is definitively better.",1709.00139v4-Table1-1.png,Table 1: Experimental Results of FISVDD and Incremental SVM on Different Data Sets,"MLP-IQA achieves the highest overall accuracy (46.5%) among the machine learning methods tested on VQA-2014val. However, this performance still falls short of human performance, which reaches an accuracy of 85.5% on the same dataset."
1809.01989v2,Which method achieved the highest tracking accuracy in terms of minimizing the sum of absolute percentage errors? Does this necessarily mean it had the best overall performance?,"The Ridge method achieved the lowest sum of absolute percentage errors (136.84), indicating the highest tracking accuracy in terms of minimizing absolute deviations from the index. However, this doesn't necessarily translate to the best overall performance.",1809.01989v2-Table1-1.png,Table 1. Absolute percentage errors for different methods,UnCoRd-VG-E
1709.02418v2,What is the effect of performing a left-swap on a binary vector y at index j′?,The left-swap increases the number of misclassified pairs by one.,1709.02418v2-Figure1-1.png,"Illustration of how performing a left-swap on binary vector y at index j′ yields a new vector z such that the number of misclassified pairs h(z, ŷ) is one more than h(y, ŷ). Specifically, ŷ misclassifies pairs (3, 4), (3, 5), (3, 7), and (6, 7) w.r.t. to y, since for each such pair (i, j), ŷi < ŷj but yi > yj . In contrast, ŷ misclassifies (3, 4), (3, 6), (3, 7), (5, 6), and (5, 7) w.r.t. to z.","The proposed method utilizes Light-CNN as both the source of the identity features and face verification loss. This allows the method to transfer the appearance of eyes, eyebrows, hairs, etc., while keeping other factors intact, e.g., head pose, shape of face, and facial expression."
