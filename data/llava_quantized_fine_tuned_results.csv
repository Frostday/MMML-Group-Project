When α is small, the loss function is smooth and has a gentle slope. When α is large, the loss function is jagged and has a steep slope. This means that the loss function is more sensitive to small changes in the input. When α is small, the loss function is less sensitive to small changes in the input.

1701.03077v10,Why did the authors choose to use a nonlinearity to curve α before fitting the cubic hermite spline?,"The authors chose to use a nonlinearity to curve α before fitting the cubic hermite spline because it allows for increased knot density near α = 2 and decreased knot density when α > 4. This helps to better approximate the log partition function, which is difficult to evaluate for arbitrary inputs.",1701.03077v10-Figure8-1.png,"Because our distribution’s log partition function log(Z (α)) is difficult to evaluate for arbitrary inputs, we approximate it using cubic hermite spline interpolation in a transformed space: first we curve α by a continuously differentiable nonlinearity that increases knot density near α = 2 and decreases knot density when α > 4 (top) and then we fit an evenly-sampled cubic hermite spline in that curved space (bottom). The dots shown in the bottom plot are a subset of the knots used by our cubic spline, and are presented here to demonstrate how this approach allocates spline knots with respect to α.","The authors chose to use a nonlinearity to curve α before fitting the cubic hermite spline because the cubic hermite spline is a piecewise polynomial that is defined over a grid of points. The nonlinearity allows the authors to smooth out the piecewise polynomial and make it more continuous. This is important because the nonlinearity helps to reduce the discontinuities that are present in the piecewise polynomial. By using the nonlinearity to curve α, the authors are able to make the resulting function more continuous and smoother. This is important because the resulting function is used to predict the value of α at new points. The nonlinearity helps to make the resulting function more accurate and reliable."

FGR (equivalent to gFGR with α = −2) is shown as a dashed line and a square, and shapeannealed gFGR for each noise level is shown as a dotted line.","The performance of gFGR improves as the shape parameter α increases. This is evident from the figure, which shows that the mean squared error (MSE) decreases as α increases. This means that the model is becoming more accurate as the shape parameter α increases.

This is particularly true for the gFGR model, which is able to capture more complex patterns in the data than the other models.

This is because the ground truth is the most accurate representation of the image, and the image representation that is closest to the ground truth will be the most accurate representation of the image. The image representation that is closest to the ground truth will also be the most detailed and highest-quality representation of the image.

This is evident from the figure, which shows that the sensitivity of the proposed method increases as the value of $\power$ increases. This is because the CIFAR-10 dataset has a larger number of classes, which makes it more challenging to learn the optimal parameters.

1701.03077v10,How does the shape of the negative log-likelihood (NLL) and probability density functions change as the value of α increases?," As the value of α increases, the NLL functions become more peaked and the probability density functions become more concentrated around the mean.",1701.03077v10-Figure2-1.png,The negative log-likelihoods (left) and probability densities (right) of the distribution corresponding to our loss function when it is defined (α ≥ 0). NLLs are simply losses (Fig. 1) shifted by a log partition function. Densities are bounded by a scaled Cauchy distribution.,"The shape of the negative log-likelihood (NLL) and probability density functions change as the value of α increases. The NLL and probability density functions become more peaked and narrow as the value of α increases. This is because the value of α determines the width of the distribution of the samples from the posterior distribution. A smaller value of α results in a narrower distribution, which leads to a more peaked and narrow NLL and probability density function. Conversely, a larger value of α results in a wider distribution, which leads to a more diffuse NLL and probability density function. This effect is more pronounced for the NLL than for the probability density function."

The leftmost column shows the images which are used as input to each autoencoder. Reconstructions from models using general distributions tend to be sharper and more detailed than reconstructions from the corresponding model that uses normal distributions, particularly for the DCT or wavelet representations, though this difference is less pronounced than what is seen when comparing samples from these models. The DCT and wavelet models trained with Cauchy distributions or Student’s t-distributions systematically fail to preserve the background of the input image, as was noted when observing samples from these distributions.","The choice of distribution affects the quality of the reconstructions by determining the type of noise that is added to the image. In the figure, the reconstructions are shown for different distributions. The distributions with higher entropy, such as the Gaussian distribution, add more noise to the image, resulting in lower quality reconstructions. On the other hand, the distributions with lower entropy, such as the uniform distribution, add less noise to the image, resulting in higher quality reconstructions. The choice of distribution can also affect the diversity of the reconstructions, with some distributions producing more similar reconstructions than others. Overall, the choice of distribution can have a significant impact on the quality and diversity of the reconstructions."

From Akopyan and Segal-Halevi (2018).,"The relationship between the complexity of a cake shape and the minimum number of blanks required for a complete partition into smaller pieces is that the minimum number of blanks increases as the complexity of the cake shape increases. This is because the complexity of a cake shape is a measure of the number of different shapes that can be formed from the cake, and the minimum number of blanks required for a complete partition into smaller pieces is a measure of the number of different shapes that can be formed from the cake. As the number of different shapes that can be formed from the cake increases, the minimum number of blanks required for a complete partition into smaller pieces also increases."

This means that 2-D division can capture more detail and structure in the image, while 1-D division can only capture the most basic information. This difference is important because it affects the performance of the models that are trained on the images. For example, the models trained on 2-D division may perform better on tasks that require the preservation of spatial information, such as object recognition or scene understanding. On the other hand, the models trained on 1-D division may perform better on tasks that require the most basic information, such as image classification or object detection."

1. Search Strategy: While previous methods primarily rely on greedy search, which becomes increasingly inefficient for longer sequences, Seq2Sick employs group lasso regularization and projected gradient descent with gradient regularization. This allows for simultaneous searching of all replacement positions, leading to improved efficiency.

2. Targeted Attack Type: Existing methods focus on targeting specific classes or binary classifications, while Seq2Sick introduces a novel ""keyword"" target type, allowing attacks to be directed towards specific keywords within the generated sequence.",1803.01128v3-Table1-1.png,"Table 1: Summary of existing works that are designed to attack RNN models. “BINARY” indicates the attack is for binary classifications, and there is no difference between untargeted and targeted attack in this case. “CLASS” means targeted attack to a specific class. “KEYWORD” means targeted attack to a specific keyword. Here we omit follow-up works based on Seq2Sick.","The key differences between Seq2Sick and existing attack methods on RNN-based models are that Seq2Sick is more efficient and requires less memory than existing attack methods.

The other datasets provide data points at lower temporal resolutions."
1703.07015v3,What are the different types of layers in the LSTNet model and how are they connected?,"The LSTNet model has four main types of layers:

1. Convolutional layer: This layer extracts local dependency patterns from the input data. 
2. Recurrent and recurrent-skip layer: These layers capture long-term dependencies in the data. 
3. Fully connected and element-wise sum output layer: This layer combines the outputs from the convolutional and recurrent layers to produce the final prediction.
4. Autoregressive layer: This layer provides a linear bypass to the non-linear neural network part of the model. 

The convolutional layer receives the input data and passes its output to the recurrent and recurrent-skip layers. These layers then pass their output to the fully connected and element-wise sum output layer. The autoregressive layer receives the input data directly and its output is also fed into the fully connected and element-wise sum output layer.",1703.07015v3-Figure2-1.png,Figure 2: An overview of the Long- and Short-term Time-series network (LSTNet),"The LSTNet model consists of three different types of layers: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer. The input layer takes in the input data, which is then passed through the hidden layer. The hidden layer uses a ReLU activation function to non-linearly transform the input data. The output layer then takes the output from the hidden layer and uses a softmax activation function to produce the final output. The hidden layer is connected to the output layer through the attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input data. The attention mechanism is implemented using a dot-product operation and a softmax function. The output layer is also connected to the input layer through the feed-forward mechanism, which allows the model to learn from the input data. The feed-forward mechanism is implemented using a dot-product operation and a ReLU activation function."

1703.04887v4,What is the relationship between the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) and the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model? Why is there a trade-off when choosing the value of N?,"The table and passage show that the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model generally improves as the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) increases. However, this improvement plateaus after N reaches a certain point (around 20 in this case).

There is a trade-off when choosing the value of N because increasing N also increases the computational complexity and training time. While a higher N leads to more accurate reward estimations and better performance, it also requires more computational resources and longer training times. Therefore, choosing the optimal N involves balancing the desired performance with the available computational resources and time constraints.",1703.04887v4-Table3-1.png,"Table 3: The translation performance of the BRCSGAN with different N for Monte Carlo search. ”-” means that the proposed model shows no improvement than the pre-trained generator or it can not be trained stably. With N set as 0, it is referred to as the pretrained generator. Similarly, we only report results on the RNNSearch and λ is set as 0.7.","The relationship between the number of Monte Carlo samples (N) and the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model is that as N increases, the translation performance of the BR-CSGAN model also increases. However, there is a trade-off when choosing the value of N. This is because increasing N requires more computational resources, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. On the other hand, decreasing N may result in lower translation performance. The optimal value of N depends on the specific task and the available computational resources."

We report the results on the Chinese-English translation tasks. RNNSearch is taken as the generator.,"The initial accuracy of the discriminator has a significant impact on the BLEU score. When the discriminator is highly accurate, the BLEU score is higher. This is because the discriminator is able to accurately identify the positive examples in the training set, which allows the generator to learn from these examples more effectively. On the other hand, when the discriminator is less accurate, the BLEU score is lower. This is because the generator may learn from incorrect examples, which can lead to lower quality generated text. Overall, the initial accuracy of the discriminator plays a crucial role in determining the quality of the generated text."
1703.04887v4,How does BR-CSGAN compare to MRT in terms of translation performance and what is the likely reason for this difference?,"BR-CSGAN consistently outperforms MRT on both Chinese-English and English-German translation tasks, achieving higher BLEU scores.

While both methods optimize similar objectives, BR-CSGAN uses a reinforcement learning procedure with a dynamic discriminator to maximize rewards for the generator. This dynamic feedback seems to be more effective than the static objective and random sampling approach used by MRT, leading to better translation performance.",1703.04887v4-Table2-1.png,Table 2: BLEU score on Chinese-English and EnglishGerman translation tasks for MRT and BR-CSGAN.,"The table shows that BR-CSGAN outperforms MRT in terms of translation performance. This is likely due to the fact that BR-CSGAN uses a more complex model architecture, which allows it to better capture the structure of the input image. Additionally, BR-CSGAN uses a multi-scale training strategy, which allows it to learn more detailed features from the input image. This leads to better translation results."

Left: conventional distant supervision. Each of the textual relations will be labeled with both KB relations, while only one is correct (blue and solid), and the other is wrong (red and dashed). Right: distant supervision with global statistics. The two textual relations can be clearly distinguished by their co-occurrence distribution of KB relations. Statistics are based on the annotated ClueWeb data released in (Toutanova et al., 2015).","Conventional distant supervision is problematic because it requires a large amount of labeled data to train the model. This is inefficient and time-consuming, especially when the amount of unlabeled data is large. Additionally, it is difficult to obtain labeled data for certain tasks, such as image classification, where the data is not readily available. This makes it challenging to train a model that can perform well on the task. To overcome these challenges, unsupervised learning and self-supervision have been proposed, which can be used to train a model without the need for labeled data. These methods can be used to train a model that can perform well on the task, even when the amount of labeled data is limited.

1803.06506v3,What is the role of the Joint Attention Module in the model?,The Joint Attention Module takes the embedded image and phrase features as input and uses them to induce a parameterization for spatial attention. This spatial attention map is then used by the decoder to predict the common concept.,1803.06506v3-Figure2-1.png,"Figure 2. An overview of our model for unsupervised visual grounding of phrases. The encoder takes in a set of image-phrase pairs, indexed by i, all sharing a common concept. The encoder embeds the image and the phrase to Vi and ti respectively.

In addition, the decoder also predicts the common concept independently for each pair (i). For details, see Section 3.2.","The Joint Attention Module is responsible for attending to the input sequence and generating a set of attention weights. These attention weights are then used to compute the attention-weighted sum of the input sequence, which is then fed into the Transformer Encoder to generate the output sequence. The attention weights are learned through a self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence. This helps the model to better understand the context of the input sequence and generate more accurate output."

1803.06506v3,"Why does the Semantic self-supervision model perform better on ReferIt (mask) compared to ReferIt (bbox), and how does this relate to the difference in performance between Visual Genome and Flickr30k datasets? ","The Semantic self-supervision model performs better on ReferIt (mask) compared to ReferIt (bbox) because mask-based annotations are considered more precise and accurate for measuring localization performance than bounding boxes. Masks tightly encompass the specific region referred to by the phrase, whereas bounding boxes can include extraneous areas. 

This relates to the difference in performance between Visual Genome and Flickr30k because both Visual Genome and ReferIt (mask) contain phrases that refer to very specific regions or non-salient objects. Precise localization is crucial for achieving high accuracy on these datasets. Flickr30k, on the other hand, annotates all bounding boxes referring to a phrase, leading to potentially less precise localization requirements and generally higher performance across methods. ",1803.06506v3-Table2-1.png,Table 2. Phrase grounding evaluation on 3 datasets using the pointing game metric. See Section 5 for mask vs bbox explanation for ReferIt.,"The Semantic self-supervision model performs better on ReferIt (mask) compared to ReferIt (bbox) because the masked images are more challenging to predict than the bboxes. The masked images have a higher proportion of objects that are not visible in the image, which makes it more difficult for the model to predict the correct object. This is because the model has to predict the object based on the context of the image, rather than just looking at the image itself. The difference in performance between the Visual Genome and Flickr30k datasets is related to the difference in the types of objects present in the datasets. The Visual Genome dataset contains a higher proportion of objects that are not visible in the image, while the Flickr30k dataset contains a higher proportion of objects that are visible in the image. This makes it easier for the model to predict the correct object in the Visual Genome dataset, and more difficult in the Flickr"

This is shown in the figure, where the ""Loss"" loss type has the highest accuracy when the concept batch size is 5k. The other loss types also perform well, but the ""Loss"" loss type performs the best. This is likely because the ""Loss"" loss type is designed to handle the concept-level information, which is more relevant when the concept batch size is 5k. The other loss types may be more focused on the sentence-level information, which may be less relevant when the concept batch size is 5k."

This is evident from the figure, which shows that the model achieves higher accuracy when the bounding box area is larger and the similarity of the concept with ImageNet classes is higher.

As the wall is shifted right, the flow increases corresonpondingly.","As the central wall obstacle is shifted to the right, the flow of water changes from a single stream to multiple streams. This is because the obstacle is blocking the flow of water, causing it to split into multiple streams as it flows around the obstacle. The number of streams increases as the obstacle is shifted closer to the camera. This effect is more pronounced when the obstacle is closer to the camera, as the camera is able to capture more detail in the flow of water."

This problem can be solved by separating saliency models from saliency maps. a) Fixations are distributed according to a ground truth fixation density p(x, y | I) for some stimulus I (see supplementary material for details on the visualization). b) This ground truth density predicts different saliency maps depending on the intended metric.

Additionally, we normalized the empirical saliency maps to have zero mean and unit variance to compute the mean normalized empirical saliency map (c) which is optimal with respect to the CC metric. Then we sampled another 100000 empirical saliency maps from the original density and evaluated CC scores of the mean empirical and mean normalized empirical saliency maps (d).

1705.02798v6,How does reattention affect the redundancy and deficiency of attention distributions? Can you explain the observed differences in the impact of reattention on different blocks?,"This paper shows that reattention helps alleviate both redundancy and deficiency in attention distributions.

Redundancy: Reattention increases the KL divergence between adjacent attention blocks, indicating that the attention distributions across blocks become more distinct and less redundant.
Deficiency: Reattention reduces the KL divergence between the normalized attention distribution ($E^t$) and the ideal uniform distribution (${E^t}^*$), suggesting that the attention becomes more balanced and closer to the desired distribution.
However, the improvement in redundancy is more pronounced between the first two blocks ($E^1$ to $E^2$) than the last two blocks ($B^2$ to $B^3$). This suggests that the first reattention is more effective in capturing word pair similarities using the original word representations. In contrast, the later reattention might be negatively impacted by the highly non-linear word representations generated in the previous layers.",1705.02798v6-Table5-1.png,Table 5: Comparison of KL diverfence on different attention distributions on SQuAD dev set.,Reattention affects the redundancy and deficiency of attention distributions by reducing the redundancy and increasing the deficiency.

By assigning loss weights on foreground/background samples, the balanced cross-entropy loss can alleviate the unbalancing problem. Our proposed method performs better than the balanced cross-entropy loss, because the F-measure criterion can automatically adjust data unbalance.","The proposed FLoss method performs better than the balanced cross-entropy loss because it takes into account the spatial relationship between the object and the background.

What is the effect of increasing the value of β2 on the precision and recall of the model? "," 

Increasing the value of β2 decreases the precision and increases the recall of the model.",1805.07567v2-Figure6-1.png,"Precision, Recall, F-measure of model trained under different β2 (Eq. 1).

This characteristic gives us much flexibility to adjust the balance between recall and precision: use larger β2 in a recall-first application and lower β2 otherwise.","As the value of β2 increases, the precision and recall of the model decrease. This is because the model becomes more conservative in its predictions, which leads to a higher number of false negatives. This is illustrated by the fact that the precision and recall curves both decrease as the value of β2 increases. The curve for precision is more pronounced than the curve for recall, which means that the model is more likely to make false negatives than false positives.

Non-negative tensors are also useful for training neural networks, as they can be used to represent the weights and biases of the network in a non-negative way. This can help to prevent the network from overfitting and can also make it easier to interpret the results of the network. Non-negative tensors are also useful for representing the relationships between data in a non-negative way, which can be useful for tasks such as image classification and object detection.

1706.08146v3,What is the effect of increasing the projection dimension d on the approximation error for sparse PCA and NMF?,Increasing the projection dimension d decreases the approximation error for both sparse PCA and NMF.,1706.08146v3-Figure2-1.png,"Approximation errors Err(X,X∗) := ‖X −X∗‖F /‖X∗‖F for sparse PCA and NMF on synthetic data with varying column sparsity k of W and projection dimension d.

Err(W̃ , PW ) measures the distance between factors in the compressed domain: low error here is necessary for accurate sparse recovery. Err(Ŵ ,W ) measures the error after sparse recovery: the recovered factors Ŵ typically incur only slightly higher error than the oracle lower bound (dotted lines) where PW is known exactly.","The approximation error for sparse PCA and NMF decreases as the projection dimension d increases. This is because the projection dimension determines the number of dimensions that are used to represent the data.
